            <p>Birth registration is the first step towards recognizing a child's inalienable right as a human being. Through this registration is one of the primary activities in any hospital with a birth admission like central hospital Benin City. Over time, the statistics of birth records keep on growing due to a population increase. The control and management of such data become cumbersome due to the manual method that is being used. The use of globally accessible technologies for child-birth registration has shown great potential in this area. Therefore, this study aims to create an electronic registration system record 
            (web-based and mobile-friendly application), to ease the difficulties of the manual method of registration, managing and processing birth certificate by individuals whenever they need it. To create a software application management system to transform the manual and semi-electronic operation in the day-to-day activities of Doctors and Nurses in the central hospital Benin City.</p>
